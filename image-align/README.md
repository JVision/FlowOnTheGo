# About this library

**Image Align** is a C++ library providing variants of the classic image alignment algorithm by Lucas-Kanade.

The project emerged while working on [AAM](https://www.github.com/cheind/aam), an active appearance models library. Fitting active appearance models is
similar to the classic image alignment problem:

> The goal of image alignment is to find the locally 'best' transform between a template image and a target image by minimizing an energy function measuring the fitness of the alignment. -- <cite>Ian Matthews</cite>

# Algorithms and Features

All image alignment algorithms implemented in this library are based on the original formulation of [Lucas-Kanade](#Lucas81):

 - Forward additive algorithm
 - Forward compositional algorithm
 - Inverse compositional algorithm

For convergence and runtime reasons all algorithms support **multi-level hierarchical** matching.

The alignment algorithms are independent of the chosen warp function. Currently the library provides the following warp modes:

 - 2D Translational Warp
 - 2D Euclidean Warp
 - 2D Similarity Warp
 - 2D Affine Warp

User defined warp functions can be easily added.

# Usage

**Image Align** is quite simple to use. Start by including the necessary headers

```C++
#include <imagealign/imagealign.h>
```

Next, declare the type / precision of warp, and the alignment variant you wish to use

```C++
namespace ia = imagealign;

// Use a double precision warp describing a similarity motion
// (rotation, translation and uniform scale).
typedef ia::WarpSimilarityD WarpType;

// Use Inverse Compositional algorithm for image alignment.
typedef ia::AlignInverseCompositional<WarpType> AlignType;
```

Given a template image and a target image you can now perform alignment

```C++

cv::Mat tpl;    // The template image
cv::Mat target; // The target image

namespace ia = imagealign;

// Instance necessary objects
WarpType w;
AlignType a;

// Prepare for alignment using 3 levels of hierarchy
a.prepare(tpl, target, w, 3);

// Perform iterative alignment over all levels in hierarchy.
a.align(w, 30, 0.003);
```

When alignment has finished, ``w`` will hold the warp that best aligns the template image with the target image.

Please note, Lucas-Kanade methods are locally operating methods that require a good guess of true warp parameters to converge. To provide a guess, simple adjust the parameters of ``w`` using methods such as ``w.setParameters()`` and similar before calling ``a.align()``.

**Image Align** comes with a couple of examples that illustrate further usage. you can find these in the [examples directory](examples/). Additionally [these unit tests](tests/) might provide in-depth information.

# Building from source
**Image Alignment** requires the following pre-requisites

 - [CMake](www.cmake.org) - for generating cross platform build files
 - [OpenCV 2.x / 3.x](www.opencv.org) - for image processing related functions

To build from source

 1. Point CMake to the cloned git repository
 1. Click CMake Configure
 1. Point `OpenCV_DIR` to the directory containing the file `OpenCVConfig.cmake`
 1. Activate / Deactivate `IMAGEALIGN_USE_OPENMP`
 1. Click CMake Generate

Although **Image Alignment** should build across multiple platforms and architectures, tests are carried out on these systems
 - Windows 8/10 MSVC10 / MSVC12 x64
 - OS X 10.10 XCode 7.x x64

If the build should fail for a specific platform, don't hesitate to create an issue.
